# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNNs
This project demonstrates my skills in deep learning and image classification by building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 categories. It showcases my proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, and data preprocessing techniquesâ€”key skills relevant to a Data Scientist role.

## 1. Objective
To classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into categories such as:  
Airplanes, Cars, Birds, Cats, Deer, Dogs, Frogs, Horses, Ships, and Trucks.

## 2. Key Features
- **Deep Learning**: Designed and trained a CNN with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhanced model performance using rotations, flips, zooms, and shifts.
- **Data Visualization**: Displayed sample images from the dataset and plotted training/validation accuracy and loss curves.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved a test accuracy of **66.75%**, demonstrating robust learning.

## 3. Skills Demonstrated
- **Programming Languages**: Python (TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **Deep Learning Techniques**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Data Augmentation, Optimization
- **Data Visualization**: Plotted metrics to evaluate and improve model performance
- **Tools and Libraries**: TensorFlow, Scikit-image, Matplotlib

## 4. Results
- **Final Test Accuracy**: 66.75%
- **Validation Metrics**: Loss and Accuracy curves show steady improvement over epochs.
- **Model Effectiveness**: Successfully classified 10 distinct categories from the dataset.

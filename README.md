CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNNs
This project demonstrates my skills in deep learning and image classification by building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 categories.
It showcases my proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, and data preprocessing techniquesâ€”key skills relevant to a Data Scientist role.

Objective
To classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, and more, using a deep learning model built with Convolutional Neural Networks.

Key Features
Deep Learning: Designed and trained a CNN with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
Data Augmentation: Enhanced model performance using rotations, flips, zooms, and shifts.
Data Visualization: Displayed sample images and plotted training/validation accuracy and loss curves.
Model Performance: Achieved a test accuracy of 66.75%, demonstrating robust learning.
Skills Demonstrated
Programming Languages: Python (TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib).
Deep Learning Techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Data Augmentation, and Optimization.
Data Visualization: Plotted metrics to evaluate and improve model performance.
Tools and Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-image, Matplotlib.
Results
Final Test Accuracy: 66.75%
Validation Loss and Accuracy curves illustrate steady improvement over epochs.
The model effectively classified 10 distinct categories from the dataset.
